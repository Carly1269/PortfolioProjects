[clicking here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/game-of-thrones-dataset)

For the purpose of this project we will be using **Python** with the **NumPy** and **Pandas** libaries. We will also use the datetime library for some data type conversions.

## ASK


There are some specific questions that need to be anwered for this dataset. These questions are:
What is the average viewership per Season? 
What is the longest and shortest season in terms or running time?
What is the best and worst rated season? In IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes and Metatritic?
